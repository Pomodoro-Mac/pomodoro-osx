## What is Pomodoro?  

**Pomodoro** is a simple yet powerful time management app designed to help users stay productive while maintaining a healthy work rhythm. Built around the classic **Pomodoro Technique**, it divides your workflow into focused sessions with regular breaks — boosting concentration and preventing fatigue.  

With a clear and distraction-free design, Pomodoro makes it easy to start, pause, or adjust timers in seconds. You can **customize work and break lengths**, receive gentle reminders, and analyze performance statistics over time. The app keeps everything lightweight and efficient, running quietly in the background while you focus on your tasks.  

It also features **automatic idle detection**, **progress tracking**, and **daily summaries** that visualize your productivity trends. Whether you’re a student, remote worker, or creative professional, Pomodoro helps you stay consistent and make the most of your time.  

Its **seamless integration** with system notifications and **Apple Silicon optimization** ensures smooth performance and minimal energy use — making it a perfect companion for disciplined, sustainable work habits.
